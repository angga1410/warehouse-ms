This lib was inspired by **del**, I wanted a quick solution that prevented accidental deletion of files outside the current working directory, but for individual files and without the extra dependencies.\n* [write](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/write) for writing files to disk.\n\n## Install\nInstall with [npm](npmjs.org):\n\n```bash\nnpm i delete --save-dev\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar del = require('delete');\n\n// delete files asynchronously\ndel('tmp/foo.md', function(err) {\n  if (err) {throw err;}\n});\n\n// delete files synchronously\ndel.sync('tmp/foo.md');\n```\n\n### options.force\n\nAn error is thrown if you try to delete files outside of the current working directory (cwd).\n\nOverride the default behavior:\n\n```js\ndel.sync('../foo.md', {force: true});\n```\n\n## Author\n\n**Jon Schlinkert**\n \n+ [github/jonschlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert)\n+ [twitter/jonschlinkert](http://twitter.com/jonschlinkert) \n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2014 Jon Schlinkert, contributors.  \nReleased under the MIT license\n\n***\n\n_This file was generated by [verb-cli](https://github.com/assemble/verb-cli) on September 22, 2014._",
